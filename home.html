  As a twin I get asked alot of basic questions like who is older, do you dress the same, do you share a room, how can I tell you two apart, do you like the same things, what kind of twins are you, how much time are you apart? Those questions are easy to answer, but when someone asks you if twin telempathy is real, can you feel each others pain, why are you twins, or if  it's rare to be a twin, it's more difficult to answer. That's why I'm writting a website about twin facts.  </h6>
